    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">
      How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web
      security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be
      greater than 250 words
    </p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">
      To secure your website I would advise you to follow Tomasz Andrzej Nideci
      (2022) seven elements to consider when securing your website. Teach all
      employees how to secure their work and how to always have security in
      mind. Adopt a cybersecurity framework so that you will have a complex set
      of guidelines to manage security. Make sure your security tools are
      automated and integrated so that there is less room for error and problems
      can be found and eliminated early in the process. Educate employees about
      potential security problems, security standards, secure coding techniques
      etc, and scan for security vulnerabilities early. Use diverse types of
      security measures, and make sure these are integrated without all elements
      in your company, and automated as much as possible. do not rely on one
      single tool to secure your website! A way to see if the website is safe,
      is to do mock attacks and other security exercises. One last thing is to
      have white-hat hackers and other outstanding freelancers' expertise within
      your security program by maintaining a bounty program.
